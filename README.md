# ðŸ“š Personal Book Management System
This is a simple book management system using basic Python as a first-ever coding assignment, created by a group of 5 members. No GUIs or databases are implemented; outputs are in the terminal, with the book records saved in a .txt file.
<br>TO NOTE: This project is built for a *Programming Principles* course assignment on **Visual Studio Code**.

## Program Functionalities
1. Add book record(s)
2. Delete book record(s)
3. Update/Edit book record(s)
4. Display all books
5. Search for book(s)
6. Exit
**NOTE:** User is provided with a menu of actions that could be executed repeatedly until they explicitly choose the 'Exit' option

## Concepts Used
- Input and display data
- List and file processing (reading/writing)
- If control statement
- Relational and logical operators
- Loops
- User-defined functions
- Error handling and data validation

## Folder Structure
personal-book-management-system/
<br>â”œâ”€â”€ main.py # Complete code file
<br>â”œâ”€â”€ book_catalogue.txt # Text files as database
<br>â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
<br>â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
<br>â””â”€â”€ README.md

## How to Run?
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project your preferred IDE.
3. Ensure the `books_catalogue.txt` file is in the correct directory relative to your source code.
4. Run `main.py`.

## Limitations & Further Notes
- As this is a first coding project, all codes are written in a single file.
- File I/O may need improvement.
- The `books_catalogue.txt` file is an example consisting of 20 books, with details separated by a semicolon (;). This can be edited based on your personal needs.
